It should be stressed that I have mostly no idea what I'm doing.

Combot is a Discord bot that parses JSON files of character movelists and displays them in Discord chat using embeds.

Invite the bot to your server using this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=302295833208946689&scope=bot&permissions=11264

Although core functionality is complete, this bot is still largely being rewritten, and will undergo changes as I get a better idea of what I'm doing.

The bot is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py wrapper, BS4, FuzzyWuzzy, and DateUtils.

To run the bot, create a txt file in the same directory as tekkenbot.py, paste your token in it and name it token.txt. Then execute tekkenbot.py.
